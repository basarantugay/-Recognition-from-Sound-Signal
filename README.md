Word and Person Recognition from Sound Signal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Sung by different people to which people the words belong and what are these words determination by software is
carried out.

• For feature extraction of sound, after the words are framed; FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) is taken for each frame.

• The obtained frequency components were used in LPC(Linear Predictive Coding) and SVM(Support Vector
Machine) algorithms for matching words and person.
